## Problem Statement
How do we manage a room of learners with different experience levels and learning speeds? CLC would like to provide support for mentors and instructors to identify learners that are struggling with pace and are not comfortable publicly voicing it. Please also consider ease of use for children or those that are newer to technology.

# Solution
An android app for students or workshop attendees and Tutors/mentors that provides the below functionality:

## For Students
- allows the students to rate their understanding, speed of content ( a cta within the app). if students are having issues with the content that was taught - they then select from a list of keywords that were mentioned within the lesson, so the mentor knows what to approach the student about. 

## For instructor/mentor
- the instructor adds the lesson topics which is broken into sections, and adds keywords from the lesson to help the student identify what they need help on. the instructor/mentors receive the data about the specific levels of understanding, if the content is being taught to fast/slow and what keywords the student(s) are not fully understanding. with this information the instructor/mentors can gather data around what students need extra help. So the mentors/ tutors can poll after every section completion to receive feedback
